Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sectors of renewable energy in the United States. About 3% of the total electricity in the United States was generated by wind turbines in 2012 (according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration), which is equivalent to the annual electricity use for about 12 million households. The amount of electricity generated by wind has increased from about 6 billion kilowatt hours (kwh) in 2000 to 140 billion kwh in 2012.

In response to the Department of Interior’s *Powering Our Future* initiative, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has begun investigating how to assess the impacts of wind energy development on wildlife at a national scale, and has created a publicly-available [national dataset](http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/817/) and [interactive mapping application](http://eerscmap.usgs.gov/windfarm/) of wind turbines. Developers, [there's an API, too](http://energy.usgs.gov/OtherEnergy/WindEnergy.aspx#3872330-data).
